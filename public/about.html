<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello People! I am Susmitha.<br></p>

<p>Growing up as an introvert, I was always the shy child who often missed out on opportunities due to my overwhelming fear of social interactions.<br>
   My natural inclination to retreat into my own world made it difficult for me to engage with others and seize the chances that came my way.<br>
   However, as I grew older, my parents' unwavering support and encouragement played a crucial role in helping me confront and overcome my fears.<br>
   With their guidance, I gradually built my confidence and learned to navigate social situations with greater ease.<br>
   This transformation has allowed me to take control of my life, turning my shyness into a strength and opening doors to new and exciting opportunities.</p>

<p>Regarding my academics, I secured a 10 CGPA in my 10th grade. <br>
   In Intermediate, I achieved a score of 94.7%. <br>
   Currently, I'm pursuing my engineering degree at Vignan's Institute of Engineering for Women.<br>
</p>

<p>
  I am deeply enthusiastic about learning new technologies, especially in areas like web development, data science, and cybersecurity.<br>
  The ever-evolving nature of these fields fascinates me, and I am constantly driven by a desire to stay updated with the latest advancements. <br>
  This passion fuels my curiosity and commitment to continuous learning.
